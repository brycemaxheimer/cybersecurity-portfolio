# Cybersecurity-Portfolio

I began cybersecurity work in the U.S. Marine Corps as a 1721 (Cyber Warfare Operator) where I completed roughly 1500 hours of training and 3 years of active work.
Growing up, I had a love for computers than I was lucky enough to turn into a career. During my military service I began the Bachelors program with the SANS Technology Institute which I am around halfway done with at the time of writing this.
I now work as a SOC Analyst for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), a job I began in July of 2025.

The National Cyber League Fall Bracket (NCL) was the first official CTF I had the chance to participate in, despite prior experience from my schooling. I definitely learned a lot and grew many skills during my participation and managed to finish the individual game in the 97th percentile. I was ranked 30 out of 620 in the experienced bracket, and in the team game, we were in the 91st percentile.
It was a great chance to learn more offensively focused skills, develop blue team skills, and test my abilities that I had already developed. I came out of every challenge and gym more confident and accomplished than I went in and cannot wait to participate again next year.
